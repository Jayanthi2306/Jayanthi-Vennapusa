            "A Brief Introduction to Artificial Intelligence What is AI and how is it going to shape the future By Dibbyo Saha, Undergraduate Student, Computer Science, Ryerson University What is Artificial Intelligence? Image by Gerd Altmann from Pixabay Generally speaking, Artificial Intelligence is a computing concept that helps a machine think and solve complex problems as we humans do with our intelligence. For example, we perform a task, make mistakes and learn from our mistakes (At least the wise ones of us do!). Likewise, an AI or Artificial Intelligence is supposed to work on a problem, make some mistakes in solving the problem and learn from the problems in a self-correcting manner as a part of its self-improvement. Or in other words, think of this like playing a game of chess. Every bad move you make reduces your chances of winning the game. So, every time you lose against your friend, you try remembering the moves you made which you shouldn’t have and apply that knowledge in your next g\n"
