# 🧠 AI Coursework – PDF Parsing & Semantic Search

This project contains implementations for **Task 1** and **Task 3** of the AI coursework.  
It demonstrates how to parse PDFs into clean text, chunk the text logically, and perform semantic search using different vector databases.

---

## 📘 Task Overview

### 🧩 Task 1: PDF Parsing & Text Chunking (30 pts)
**Objective:**  
Write Python functions that:
- Parse PDF files into clean text using **PyMuPDF**.
- Chunk the text logically into 512–1024 tokens.
- Ensure no broken sentences between chunks.

**Requirements:**
- Output a list of text chunks.
- Maintain structure and readability.
- Remove metadata, headers, and page numbers.

**Bonus (5 pts):**
- Preprocessing steps like removing duplicate headers, special symbols, and noise.

### 🔍 Task 3: Vector Databases & Semantic Search (35 pts)
**Objective:**  
Use the text chunks from Task 1 to:
- Store embeddings in at least two vector databases (**FAISS**, **Chroma**, etc.).
- Implement multiple types of semantic search:
  - Cosine similarity search  
  - Dot-product similarity search  
  - (Optional) Hybrid search (keywords + embeddings)

**Compare:**  
Results based on accuracy, speed, or relevance.
